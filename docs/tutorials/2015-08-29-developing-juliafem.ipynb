    "# Developing JuliaFEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Author(s): Jukka Aho\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract**: Developer notes. In this notebook we give the general guidelines how to implement basic fundamentals to JuliaFEM. The notebook is rapidly updated and should always represent the newest \"style\" how to develop things to JuliaFEM. At this phase of project interfaces are changing rapidly. For this reason we aim to develop couple of simple functions which aim to test that elements, equations, solvers etc. work as expected, in the sense that their interface hasn't any design problems. (Yes, we do believe in testing and follow also other practices proven to be good, like continuous integration). The aim of this document is not to be the guide to \"other contributors\" but is more like an guide line for all contributors, including ourselves, how things should be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstrational purposes we use the Poisson equation in our examples to demonstrate the main concepts of the package. Poisson equation has some analogies to solid mechanics. Consider for example $(EAu')' + q = 0$, which is nothing more than a Poisson equation defined in 1d.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is the second important document in this source repository, any questions or suggestions araising from this notebook are very welcome and desirable and should be adressed to the our issue log: https://github.com/JuliaFEM/JuliaFEM.jl/issues. Easiest way to make world better is to register GitHub (takes 1 min) and drop an issue. And the most important document? It's the \"how to contribute\" guide, see https://github.com/JuliaFEM/JuliaFEM.jl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook briefly we have defined the following \"objects\":\n",
    "\n",
    "**Element**: object which holds basis functions and fields. One is able to interpolate fields using element. Introduction of new basis functions needs new elements. Typical elements: Lagrange elements, hierarchical elements, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation**: object which defines some field equation, like Poisson equation $\\Delta u = f$, elasticity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\sigma = f$, etc., which needs to be solve. This is the physics we are trying to solve by approximating the equations in element area by some interpolation function provided by element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: object which maps equations to elements. For example, HeatProblem which maps Poisson equation to Lagrange elements or ElasticityProblem which maps elasticity equation to Lagrange elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solver**: object which takes one or more problems, solves them using some strategy (iterative methods, multigrid, direct methods, ...) and updates corresponding fields to elements. The is the section where any numerical crunching happens and is targeted to high-performance computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are quite well separated so that development process can focus just one of thing of interest. In this notebook we will give instructions to all of the sections describing the whole development process from element level to global assembly and solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have\n",

    "- [ ] **`test_solver`**\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be used to test that implementation has all necessary things defined.\n",
    "\n",

Typically the residual vector is defined $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}-\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}}=0$. In our case the residual vector must be multiplied by $-1$ after the linearization so that the increment can be *added* to old result. In some text books this has already be taken into account by defining right hand side as $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}}-\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ while linearization is still done for vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{int}}-\\mathbf{f}_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.

Indeed it's a very elegant approach to model e.g. hyperelasticity and other systems without a loss of energy. When system has energy dissipation, principle of minimum potential energy cannot be used. Possible situations when this happens include e.g. material plasticity or friction. In these situations the principle of virtual work is useful.\n",
