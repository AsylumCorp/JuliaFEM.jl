    "text": "Pages = [\"index.md\", \"api.md\"]The JuliaFEM project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed Finite Element Method.The JuliaFEM software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large Finite Element Models across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. The basic design principle is: everything is nonlinear. All physics models are nonlinear from which the linearization are made as a special cases. "
